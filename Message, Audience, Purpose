Our message is that everything we have is designed to help you relive your history. Our goal is to turn time's arrow into a circle and then to keep moving forward as fast as we can handle it. We encourage everyone to experience this trip to the past. We put a lot of thought into this and decided that the Vikingverden theme park will be catered to be a good experience for all age groups. The Vikingverden theme park will provide a wide variety of rides for children and adults, encouraging everyone to enjoy an educational and entertaining day out. The theme park will have rides for every age bracket and it will try to cater to the needs of all of its visitors. Today we live in a different era from that which was lived in by our ancestors. Many of our ancestors lived when information had to be written down and stored in books and manuscripts that were difficult to produce, even after the printing press was invented. Today with our advanced high-speed internet connections, it has become easier than ever to obtain a seemingly infinite amount of information. We think the change that has taken place between these two vastly different ages is revolutionary and we are barely aware of the events that caused it. Our purpose is to help people have a deeper look at how some of our predecessors lived their lives, everything they did and how the world around us all and we as humans have evolved.
